# Posture Detection Model
This project leverages the PoseNet model to detect and analyze human posture in real-time using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. PoseNet, a pre-trained machine learning model by TensorFlow, is utilized to estimate the positions of key body parts (such as shoulders, elbows, and hips) from webcam video input. The project visualizes these key points and their connections on the screen, providing insights into the user's posture. This can be used for various applications such as fitness tracking, ergonomic assessments, or interactive art installations.
